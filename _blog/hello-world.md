I started this blog to share my knowledge and improve my writing skills üöÄ\
(I do think that we tend to learn better when we write things down or try to teach someone else)

One of the most valuable resources I found was [this lesson](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/metaprogramming/) from [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course on "[metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)". It introduced me to key concepts such as:

- **Build systems** and writing `Makefile`
- **Dependency management** and versioning
- **Testing** fundamentals and best practices
- **Automation with Git Hooks, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD pipelines**
- **Static Site Generators (SSG)** like GitHub Pages and Jekyll

If you're curious about how I set up this blog, check out my guide:\
