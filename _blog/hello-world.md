I started this blog on Github Pages after learning [this lesson](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/metaprogramming/) of [Missing Semester MIT](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) which teach me about metaprogramming including concepts:

- Build system and `Makefile`
- Dependency Management and versioning
- Use Git Hooks, Github Actions and Continuous integration systems
- Static Site Generators (SSG) with Github Pages and Jekyll
